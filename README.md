# Detecting-cloaked-objects-using-Fourier-holograms
## ðŸ“„ Abstract
This project presents a concise simulation of digital holography using Fourier-domain analysis. A synthetic object. a rectangular aperture with an embedded void is encoded into a hologram via the two-dimensional Fourier transform. The resulting hologram is decomposed into amplitude and phase components, which are visualized to reveal the spatial frequency structure and phase encoding of the object.
The simulation highlights the role of phase in holographic imaging, where the objectâ€™s geometry is embedded not only in intensity but in the complex wavefront. By isolating and visualizing the phase component, the simulation underscores the importance of phase-only holography in applications such as optical encryption, wavefront shaping, and computational imaging. This work reflects foundational skills in numerical modeling, signal decomposition, and scientific visualization core competencies for graduate-level research in optics and photonics.
